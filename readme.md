## Motivation

This package was created, because the popular [money.js](http://openexchangerates.github.io/money.js/) library:
* is not maintained (last commit was ~5 years ago)
* has over 20 open issues
* does not support TypeScript
* has implicit globals
* does not have any unit tests
* [has floating point issues](#floating-point-issues)

## Highlights

- Simple API
- 0 dependencies
- Actively maintained
- Well tested
- [Easy migration from money.js](#migrating-from-moneyjs)
- Written in TypeScript

## Install

```
$ npm install cashify
```

## Usage

### With constructor

```js
const {Cashify} = require('cashify');

const rates = {
	GBP: 0.92,
	EUR: 1.00,
	USD: 1.12
};

const cashify = new Cashify({base: 'EUR', rates});

const result = cashify.convert(10, {from: 'EUR', to: 'GBP'});

console.log(result); //=> 9.2
```

### Without constructor

Using the `Cashify` constructor is not required. Instead, you can just use the `convert` function:

```js
const {convert} = require('cashify');

const rates = {
	GBP: 0.92,
	EUR: 1.00,
	USD: 1.12
};

const result = convert(10, {from: 'EUR', to: 'GBP', base: 'EUR', rates});

console.log(result); //=> 9.2
```

### Basic parsing

Cashify supports basic parsing, so you can pass a `string` to the `amount` argument and the `from` currency will be automatically detected:

```js
const {Cashify, convert} = require('cashify');

const rates = {
	GBP: 0.92,
	EUR: 1.00,
	USD: 1.12
};

const cashify = new Cashify({base: 'EUR', rates});

// with constructor
cashify.convert('â‚¬10 EUR', {to: 'GBP'});

// without constructor
convert('$10 USD', {to: 'GBP', base: 'EUR', rates});
```

## API

### Cashify({base, rates})

Constructor

##### base

Type: `string`

Base currency

##### rates

Type: `object`

Object containing currency rates (for example from an API, such as Open Exchange Rates)

### convert(amount, {from, to, base, rates}) *`with and without constructor`*

Returns conversion result (`number`)

##### amount

Type: `number` or `string`

Amount of money you want to convert. You can either use just a number or a string with currency code (ex. `â‚¬10 EUR` or `$1.99 HKD`). If you choose the second option, you do not need to specify the [`from`](#from) argument, as cashify will detect it.

##### from

Type: `string`

Currency from which you want to convert. You don't need to specify it if you declare it in the [`amount`](#amount) argument.

##### to

Type: `string`

Currency to which you want to convert

##### base

Type: `string`

Base currency

##### rates

Type: `object`

Object containing currency rates (for example from an API, such as Open Exchange Rates)

## Migrating from [money.js](http://openexchangerates.github.io/money.js/)

With `Cashify` constructor:

```diff
- const fx = require('money');
+ const {Cashify} = require('cashify');

- fx.base = 'EUR';
- fx.rates = {
-	GBP: 0.92,
-	EUR: 1.00,
-	USD: 1.12
- };

+ const rates = {
+	 GBP: 0.92,
+	 EUR: 1.00,
+	 USD: 1.12
+ };

+ const cashify = new Cashify({base: 'EUR', rates});

- fx.convert(10, {from: 'GBP', to: 'EUR'});
+ cashify.convert(10, {from: 'GBP', to: 'EUR'});
```

With `convert` function:

```diff
- const fx = require('money');
+ const {convert} = require('cashify');

- fx.base = 'EUR';
- fx.rates = {
-	GBP: 0.92,
-	EUR: 1.00,
-	USD: 1.12
- };

+ const rates = {
+	 GBP: 0.92,
+	 EUR: 1.00,
+	 USD: 1.12
+ };

- fx.convert(10, {from: 'GBP', to: 'EUR'});
+ convert(10, {from: 'GBP', to: 'EUR', base: 'EUR', rates});
```

## Floating point issues

When working with currencies, decimals only need to be precise up to the smallest cent value while avoiding common floating point errors when performing basic arithmetic.

Let's take a look at the following example:

```js
const fx = require('money');
const {Cashify} = require('cashify');

const rates = {
	GBP: 0.92,
	USD: 1.12
};

fx.rates = rates;
fx.base = 'EUR';

const cashify = new Cashify({base: 'EUR', rates});

fx.convert(10, {from: 'EUR', to: 'GBP'}); //=> 9.200000000000001
cashify.convert(10, {from: 'EUR', to: 'GBP'}); //=> 9.2
```

As you can see, money.js doesn't handle currencies correctly and therefore a floating point issues are occuring. Even though there's just a minor discrepancy between the results, if you're converting large amounts, that can add up.

Cashify solves this problem the same way as [currency.js](https://github.com/scurker/currency.js/) - by working with integers behind the scenes. This should be okay for most reasonable values of currencies.
